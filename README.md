# Pursuit Force Decompilation

Decompilation of  Pursuit Force (2005)

## What is Pursuit Force?

Pursuit Force is an action game developed by Bigbig Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit_Force)

## What's the goal?

For now, the goal is to extract all 3D models, textures and audio while keeping the old ones in the repository so that the game is still playable if downloaded (except for ALL.PAK and MusicPSP.pak because they are too large to be uploaded).

## Progress

- [X] Extract all .PAK files
- [ ] Convert all 3D models to .OBJ
- [ ] Convert all audio files to .WAV
- [ ] Convert all textures to .PNG
- [ ] Rewrite all scripts in C++

## Credits

No one so far :(
